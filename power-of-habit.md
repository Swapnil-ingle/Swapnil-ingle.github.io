So, I've been reading this awesome book "The power of habit" - Charles Duhigg. The book talks about how habits are formed, how they can be hacked, etc. The book don't just make statements but is based on solid scientific experiments around habits. I found the book to be very relevant and I got hooked with it right away. I'm writing this blog to consolidate some facts, techniques and some great examples the book provide.

Hopefully, this should encourage the reader to go ahead and read the book.

# The habit loop

While talking about how habits are formed the author describes the habit loop, a behaviour that causes people to form habits. A habit loop consists of three parts.
1. The cue
2. The routine
3. The reward
There is an experiment discussed in the book, where the subject is suffering from a condition and cannot remember things for more than some minutes. There are 16 objects sticked to rectangular cardboard, and the objects is divided into two groups. One group having sticker of "Correct" and other group objects have "Incorrect" the goal is to memorize all the objects with the "Correct" label. Normally, people remember the object in fout to five rounds while chimps take a week to solve the riddle. The patient is tested with the experiment two months pass, he is not able to solve it but he does gets better at the riddle his accuracy by the second month is 95%. Which is astonishing, considering the fact that the patient had to be re-acquantied with the doctors every day because he cannot remember anything.
After two months the researchers shift the experiment slightly, now the patient has to describe each object. When he gets the cardboard he turns it over and starts searching for the sticker, when asked he said, "I don't know, I just felt like I was suppose to do this". This was a habit for the patient, this also proves that habit does not have anything to do with memory the brain makes decision without any prior information, because of the habit. 
Say, for example, during work when the phones buzzes, people tend to check for the message arrived as this is a habit. It seems that the brian does not consider the rational decision-making part when it comes to habit, as made clear by the experiment.
