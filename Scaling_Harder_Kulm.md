## Harder Kulm

"Kulm" is "Hill" in German so the name "Harder Kulm" loosely translates to "Harder Hill" or "Tough Hill". This is a mountain peak in Interlaken, Switzerland. It stands high at 4337 feet (1322 meters). It was mid January when I visited, and the mountain top was filled with snow.

If you check the direction from Google Maps, it says the trail is 2.5 KM from the base, but don't be fooled it'll show just the road length and not the off-trail hiking distance that starts at the end of this road. This is much farther than 2.5 KM, locals told me that it might be around 4.5 - 5 KM.

## The Ascend

The hiking trail is really steap and ascending is painstakingly difficult, I was making stops every 20 mins and could feel my heart pump blood to the brain, and to top that I forgot my water-bottle, Genius! So I did the whole hike without any water intakes whatsoever. That's around 10 KM up and down, which might not sound much to people who don't hike, but holy mother of Jesus was it difficult.

After around covering 80% of the hike, I stoped at the roadside to catch my, you know, ~~breath~~ heart (Which I felt was in my mouth and would fall out anytime), anyways, this is when I noticed that it's snowing.

That's a snowflake! They're really small and my camera not competent enough.

During the ascent, there was a spot that was really scary. I literally sat down for 15 minutes and contemplated whether I wanted to do this or not.

Okay, It might not seem that scary in the picture, but believe me you, the far-left side of the picture is a never-ending snow valley. The trail is all snow covered and one slip could've lead to god-knows-what. I was at the final stages though and could see the peak and I thought I could not turn back now, I commited and crossed that walk-of-death. I might mention that the snow in the trail is crystallined by all the foots trampeling it, which just adds to the difficulty and to top that I didn't had proper hiking gears, Genius! I know!

## The ascend was exhausting but the descend was treacherous

There I was at the top of this thing, all the aching has paid off and the view was worth it. There was not a single soul at the top, which made it even more special. This place is filled with tourist in summer btw.

Ok, now it was time to address the elephant in the room. I knew the hiking down was going to be scarier, while climbing you don't look down at the valley, you are motivated, you have will-power, you are focused on the peak, the view it'll have and everything, but while descending it's the opposite, you don't have enough motivation, your will-power is all used up by the climb, you're leaving behind the hill-top, the gorgeous view, you're sort-of acknowleding the end of an experience, and you remember that there's going to be office tomorrow, Balls!

I cannot stress it enough that how much I cursed myself for not bringing good trekking boots and trekking sticks. There was crystallined snow, water dripping from the side and mud, it was hell. I was slipping and balancing at all the crucial turns, at some points there was literally 3 feet of walking-ground and a smooth snow-white steep valley beside it and I could not step a firm foot.

It was really dangerous, so if you're reading this, please don't forward this to my parents.

All in all, a great experience, 10/10 won't do again alone or without proper gear.
