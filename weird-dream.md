## Weird Dream

> 20-Feb-2021 - 11:50 AM

This was during a pre-afternoon nap around 11:00 AM.

I don't know how it got started. But I recall that everything being dark. I was in the same place (my room) sitting on my bed, but nobody else was around there. The environment was bleak and there was no sign of any light source around. It seemed almost like an alternate universe.

I soon realized that this is a dream and I could then sense myself sleeping and dreaming. I thought this is a weird dream, because normally in a dream there is some narrative going on but here I was sitting all alone in a dark room with nothing to follow.

I thought this is peculiar and I should now wake up - feeling enough rested. But when I woke-up I was still in the same room (same universe). I was confused because It felt like I actually was awake. I roamed around a bit and realized this is still a dream.

I did the wake-up sequence multiple times - deciding to wake-up followed by lifting up the sheet from my head and waking up.

However, whenever I was waking up, my normal body did not get up and I was still in the same dream. I could still sense my sleeping body though, my right hand tucked below my sleeping head, the sheets covering my body, and the smartwatch on my wrist which was vibrating because of the alarm going off.

The waking-up part felt real, like my actual body was now up and the dream is finally over but as soon as I was up, I realized that this was still the dream. Still feeling my asleep body but unable to retrieve it from it's sleeping state.

I was terrified and could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I tried calling (more like yelling) my roommate's name, who was in the other room in a hope that he'd hear my voice and nudge my real body awake.

After sometime of yelling, which felt like an hour, I thought maybe this is death or something, maybe I've died and this is what the afterlife is - being stuck in some weird infinite time-loop.

At the end of it, I somehow how ahold of my real body and jerked it awake, finally waking up from the dream.

This was the most weird and terrifying dream I had that I can recall.

I am wondering whether this was a lucid dream.
