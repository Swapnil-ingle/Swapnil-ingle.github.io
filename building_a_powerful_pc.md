## Build a powerful PC under 33K rupees

The aim of the this article is to help you build a killer performance machine for under 35,000 rupees. This would be a great value-for-money computer that would suffice to your working/gaming need.

This is the complete list of parts that we're going to use:
* Processor --> Ryzen 3 3200G (Link) --> 8500 Rs.
* Motherboard --> Gigabyte B450M Gaming (Link) --> 8500 Rs.
> Alternative --> GIGABYTE GA-A320M-S2H --> 6000 Rs. 
* Power Supply Unit (PSU) --> 550 Watt Thermaltake TR2 (Link) --> 4200 Rs.
> Alternative --> Corsair CV450 --> 3000 Rs.
* Storage --> Kingston 250GB SSD (Link) --> 3000 Rs.
> Alternative --> WD Green 120 GB SSD --> 1800 Rs.
* RAM --> (2x) XPG ADATA 8GB 3200MHz (Link) --> 6000 Rs.
> Alternative --> (1x) XPG ADATA 8GB 3200MHz --> 3000 Rs.
* Case --> *Choose from options given in the section* --> 4000 Rs.
* RGB Fan (Optional) --> 1500 Rs.
* RGB Lighting Strip (Optional) --> 1000 Rs.

We're looking for the build to be budget-friendly as well as upgradeable, this will bump up the price a bit however, I will also mention some alternate parts if you're on an even tighter budget and don't care much for upgradability.

### Processor (~ 8500 Rs)

The processor is the rock where every computation happens. Diving into some techincal details, basically a processor is array of transitors arranged in logic-gates enabling complex computations.

A CPU is different than GPU, both being processors are optimized for different types of inputs and computations. 

We can say that a CPU has a mastery in floating-points computation and knows how to run multiple processes parallely while a GPU has mastery in doing cross-products computation which is required while rendering pixels on screen - gaming, rendering 3D models and animations, etc.

![alt text](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710U2ZVk31L._SL1384_.jpg "Ryzen3 3200G")

We will be using an APU as the processor instead of a CPU/GPU. An APU has a built-in GPU. Ryzen 3 3200G is very well capable of handling the average graphic need and does not need a dedicated graphics processing unit (GPU).

Ryzen 3 3200G is a 4 core CPU with a base clock of 3.6 GHz and a boost clock of 4.0 GHz. The inbuilt GPU is Vega 8 graphics, which is enough for 720p (high) and 1080p (low) gaming.

This will cost your around Rs. 8500.

### Motherboard (~ 8500 Rs)

Motherboard is the "enabler" of all the PC components, it keeps every component in connect with each other and allows for an efficient communicate channel.

![alt text](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712MufLY2fL._SL1000_.jpg "Gigabyte B450M Gaming")

We're going for Gigabyte B450M Gaming motherboard as it is future proof in which it provides great upgradability. It supports all the Ryzen third series CPUs, upto Ryzen 9 3950x (which has 16 Cores) which is Ryzen's top-of-the-line products (as of 15-Sep-2020).

This will cost your around Rs. 8500.

> *NOTE:* This does not have in-built WiFi and bluetooth, so you'd need to buy an external WiFi/Bluetooth adapter (costs around 250 rupees).

#### Budget Option (~ 6000 Rs)

![alt-text](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Z1sLu10ZL._SL1500_.jpg "Gigabyte GA-A320M-S2H")

I'd very much recommend to go with this motherboard but if you're very tight on your budget you can go with the lower "GIGABYTE GA-A320M-S2H" which costs for around 6000 rupees.

### Power Supply Unit (PSU) (~ 4200 Rs)

Every component of the computer requires power to run, either directly from the PSU or from the motherboard. The more performant the part is the more likely it is to draw more power. This is why we need enough power supply to satisfy every parts' power draw.

![alt-text](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51tMZdu2c7L.jpg "Thermaltake TR2 550W")

We are going for a 550 Watt Thermaltake TR2, this is enough to power the machine even when you upgrade to some big boys Graphics card and a chunkier CPU.

This will cost you around 4200 Rs.

#### Budget Option (~ 3000 Rs)

![alt-text](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iE-m6mf1L._SL1200_.jpg "Corsair CV450")

On a more budget-friendly option you can go with "Corsair CV450" which would cost you around 3500 rupees.

### Storage (~ 3000 Rs)

Your data is stored and loaded from a permanent storage device, which could be hard-disk or a solid-state drive. The faster the storing and loading of the data is, the faster the response you get from the computer.

![alt-text](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JLh%2Bnx3bL._SL1500_.jpg "Kingston SSD 240GB")

A Kingston SSD of 240 GB would be enough. This costs around 3000 Rs.

#### Budget Option (~ 1800 Rs)

For more cutback you can opt for 120GB SSD, however this will severly limit your usability. You can usually get this for around 1800 Rs.

![alt-text](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81W2jdjh6ZL._SL1500_.jpg "WD 120GB SSD")

[Link](https://www.amazon.in/WDS120G2G0A-120GB-2-5-inch-Internal-Green/dp/B076XWDN6V/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=120gb+SSD&qid=1600492813&sr=8-3)

### RAM Sticks (~ 6000 Rs)

Every program is a process, and every process needs some kind of resources, for example; it might load some pictures, videos, text file(s), binary files, etc. When you run a program, its process is executed and all the dependent resources are loaded into the main-memory (also called as working-memory or random-access-memory or RAM)

This is exactly why you need good RAM sticks for a smooth user-experience, some large programs won't even run if there isn't enough RAM space.

![alt-text](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716ZJQJ4LJL._SL1500_.jpg "HyperX Fury 8GB")

We'll be using 16GB (dual-stick) RAM configuration. For the two RAM sticks we'll use HyperX Fury 8GB RAM, these are DDR4 RAM with 3200MHz memory frequency (memory frequency is directly proportional to loading speed).

At total, this will cost you around 6000 Rs.

#### Budget Option (~ 3000 Rs)

You can opt for only one 8GB RAM stick instead of two and most things will still run fine.

### CPU Case/Cabinet (~ 4000 Rs)

Even considering our cabinet budget 3000 - 5000, there are many gaming cases to choose from, here are some of my suggestions:

* [Antec NX230 NX Series-Mid Tower](https://www.amazon.in/Antec-NX230-Computer-Motherboard-Transparent/dp/B0843C1Q5Y/ref=sxin_3_sk-bs-v3-tn-desktop-eu_2a2cef570308e9131167218d4260dccd6008e95d?cv_ct_cx=Gaming+case&dchild=1&keywords=Gaming+case&pd_rd_i=B0843C1Q5Y&pd_rd_r=d7a65e3a-187c-4fa3-ab87-6f6b63587f2a&pd_rd_w=rGaaw&pd_rd_wg=MoFWt&pf_rd_p=faace55b-6e09-4265-81b4-d58d01f768e1&pf_rd_r=1ZJ7JWC947CS2P0EFNJ7&qid=1600493141&sr=1-1-6813a1a9-5679-491a-9c2b-c8f5e26f3648)

* [Redragon Grimlock GC-602](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07W67Z2WM/ref=sspa_dk_hqp_detail_aax_0?psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFPQzBDTlNSQktXNFQmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA2OTIzNDcyOFFQMEdNNTdQODFCJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0OTE3NjZaU09FSUNHVEVaRkgmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9ocXBfc2hhcmVkJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==)
* [Corsair Carbide Series 175R](https://www.amazon.in/Corsair-Carbide-Tempered-Mid-Tower-Gaming/dp/B07PF1TBZF/ref=pd_sbs_147_2/261-6819680-0370156?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07PF1TBZF&pd_rd_r=b3df6060-bffb-406d-83be-24da0e618424&pd_rd_w=ALitx&pd_rd_wg=yoCyF&pf_rd_p=00b53f5d-d1f8-4708-89df-2987ccce05ce&pf_rd_r=C5DCM6HYC0WBHQ2PV75T&psc=1&refRID=C5DCM6HYC0WBHQ2PV75T)
* [Aerocool Scar RGB Mid Tower](https://www.amazon.in/Aerocool-Scar-Tower-Tempered-Glass/dp/B07M5JN951/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=Gaming+case&qid=1600493141&refinements=p_36%3A1318504031&rnid=1318502031&s=computers&sr=1-8)

### RGB Fan and Lighting Strip (Optional) (~ 2500 Rs)

If you want to get fancy you add some RGB fans and lighting strip to your build. Keep in mind, the fans serve funtionally as well as aesthetically to keep your machine cool, if you'd excuse the pun.

Most of the cases above support multiple 120mm fans and our selection of motherboard also supports a RGB lighting strip, which can be controller via the Gigabyte software.

* [Chiptronex RGB fan](https://www.amazon.in/CHIPTRONEX-HX100-RGB-Computer-Connector/dp/B08BJSFW7B/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=RGB+fan&qid=1600493642&s=computers&sr=1-1)
* [Aerocool RGB fan - combo of 3](https://www.amazon.in/DEEPCOOL-RF120FS-3XFAN-Case-Fan/dp/B08DHDH8HK/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=RGB+fan&qid=1600493642&s=computers&sr=1-9)
* [Lighting strip](https://www.amazon.in/Deepcool-Controlled-Header-Motherboard-Devices/dp/B07GRHSS1V/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1P7KTBLLEH2XD&dchild=1&keywords=motherboard+light&qid=1600493909&sprefix=motherboard+lig%2Ccomputers%2C332&sr=8-5)

This would add nearly 2000 - 3000 rupees.

### Adding a discrete GPU (~ 10000 - 20000 Rs)

During the next few months you can invest in some ultra-short term debt funds to save some money and add a discrete GPU to this bad boy. (Go [here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) to read a summary of "Let's Talk Money" book if you want to know more about investing)

You have to be careful while upgrading the GPU, if the GPU has too much power the CPU won't be able to keep up with it and will bottleneck.

It's always a good idea to check for [bottlenecks](https://pc-builds.com/calculator/) between your CPU and GPU.

![alt-text](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Rm-JlUJqL._SL1100_.jpg "GTX 1660 Super")

I've done this for this build, Ryzen 3200g can be easily paired up with upto [GTX 1660 Super](https://www.amazon.in/Colorful-iGame-GTX-1660-Ultra/dp/B084NW6VFC/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=GTX+1660+GDDR6&qid=1600494599&s=computers&sr=1-4) cards. Which would give very significant framerates while gaming.

### Until next time
