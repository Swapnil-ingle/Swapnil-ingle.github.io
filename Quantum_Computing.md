# Quantum Computing

## Quantum.

Have you ever heard about the term, *"Quantum Physics"?* It's a branch of physics that deals with quantum stuff, duh!
Quamtum means minimal amount of physical entity. See, there are two physics normal physics and quantum physics. When we scale to the sub-atomic level, the normal notions of physics do not apply. 

You see, at sub-atomic level particles act as waves and waves act as particles. This is called as the "Wave duality" behaviour. The interesting thing here is no one could predict at what instance it nature would be like? It exibits both properties simultaneously, until you measure it - then it'll read as one of it, crazy right!? It gets crazier, its not just one of the both states, but a certain combination of one of the both states.

There is a famous thought experiment by Scientist Erwin Schroedinger called "Schroedinger's Cat", that hypothise that the cat is both alive and dead at the same time, until inspected upon by external entity.


## Quantum computers are here!

What does this has to do with you?
