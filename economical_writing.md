## Economical (or Tight) Writing
###### Lessons in being an elite writer

In Economical writing each word is placed with deliberate thought, no redundant words are used and you should not be able to simplify an already “Tight” sentence.
This is an example from a book by Harold based on Editorial writing.

The author says, imagine there is a fishmonger who puts up a sign that reads "_Fresh Fish Sold Here_"

**“Fresh Fish Sold Here”.** 
> Now, what can you cut from the sentence?

“_Here_” is of course redundant as it’s obvious that whoever can read the sign can also see the stall. “_Fresh Fish Sold ~~Here~~_”. Actually, “_Sold_” is also redundant, nobody will assume that the fish are being given away. “_Fresh Fish ~~Sold Here~~_”. On a  further thought, “_Fresh_” is also not necessary, opposite of fresh is stale and nobody would advertise stale fish, right!? 

> “~~Fresh~~ **Fish** ~~Sold Here~~”

We don’t even need “Fish” there, because whoever would be reading the sign would already know that by the smell. 
> “**~~Fresh Fish Sold Here~~**”

This is just a figurative example of upon deep thought how you can eliminate more words. Not to be taken literally. The point was to illustrate how one can employ critical thinking.

Below are some of the questions from an exercise where you practice economical writing. I have provided, for question 2, an insight on the critical thinking that goes into forging an economical sentence.

**Exercise**

**Question #1:** I will provide you with an update by the end of the day.

**Answer** I will update you by tonight. OR I will update you today.

**Question #2:** The specific point I am seeking to make is that the colours red and grey go well together.

**Answer:** Red and Grey Match

**Insights:** 
The specific point I am seeking to make is that the colours red and grey go well together.
> Point, by nature, are always specific.

The ~~specific~~ point I am seeking to make is that the colours red and grey go well together.
> "_The point I am seeking to make_" is really just saying, "_My point is..._"

My point is that the colours red and grey go well together.
> When you are making a statement it is implied that you are stating your point. No need to explicitly write it.

~~My point is that~~ The colours red and grey go well together.
> Everyone knows Red and grey are indeed colours. We can cut it out.

~~The colours~~ Red and grey go well together.

> _"Red and grey match"_

**Question #3:** I am seeking a new job at this moment in time.

**Answer:** I am seeking a new job.

**Question #4:** If there are any points on which you require explanation or further particulars we shall be glad to furnish such additional details as may be required by telephone.

**Answer:** If you have any questions, please phone.

**Question #5:** I will take your proposal into consideration.

**Answer:** I’ll consider your proposal.

**Look out to replace these:**

* At the present time → Now/Currently
* Exhibits a tendency to → tends to
* In view of the fact that → because
* A large number of → many

Don't forget to factor in other important considerations while you do that. Like, have you shrunk the meaning? That is, have you compromised the clarity of the idea too much by cutting so much? Have you made the sentence sound too clipped, perhaps?
That is, have you sacrificed too much elegance in your quest for simplicity? 

Have you removed too much of the colorfulness of the writing? Have you sacrificed too much evocativeness for simplicity? Those are the sorts of considerations you should be weighing up when performing “simplicity” operations like this, because remember we're balancing the ingredients. But where none of those other ingredients are adversely affected, cut, cut, cut for maximum efficiency.
