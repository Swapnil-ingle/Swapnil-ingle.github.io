## Economical (or Tight) Writing

In Economical writing each word is placed with deliberate thought, no redundant words are used and you should not be able to simplify an already “Tight” sentence.
This is an example from a book by Harold based on Editorial writing.

The author says, imagine there is a fishmonger who puts up a sign that says, 

**“Fresh Fish Sold Here”.** 
> Now, what can you cut from the sentence?
“Here” is of course redundant as it’s obvious that whoever can read the sign can also see the stall. 

“Fresh Fish Sold Here”. Actually, “Sold” is also redundant, nobody will assume that the fish are being given away. 

“Fresh Fish Sold Here”. On a further thought, “Fresh” is also not necessary, opposite of fresh is stale and nobody would advertise stale fish, right!? “Fresh Fish Sold Here”
We don’t even need “Fish” there, because whoever would be reading the sign would already know that by the smell. “Fresh Fish Sold Here”
This is just a figurative example of upon deep thought how you can eliminate more words. Not to be taken literally.

Look out to replace these:
At the present time → Now/Currently
Exhibits a tendency to → tends to
In view of the fact that → because
A large number of → many

Don't forget to factor in other important considerations while you do that. Like, have you shrunk the meaning? That is, have you compromised the clarity of the idea too much by cutting so much? Have you made the sentence sound too clipped, perhaps?
That is, have you sacrificed too much elegance in your quest for simplicity? Or, have you removed too much of the colorfulness of the writing? That is, have you sacrificed too much evocativeness for simplicity? Those are the sorts of considerations you should be weighing up when performing “simplicity” operations like this, because remember we're balancing the ingredients. But where none of those other ingredients are adversely affected, cut, cut, cut for maximum efficiency.
