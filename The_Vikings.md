# The Vikings

Recently I've been following up on a series on netflix, which I started way back in college, titled "The Vikings". This is a History TV produced adaptation of the vikings civilisation. The series started airing its first episode in the year 2013. So far, we've five seasons - fifty episodes - of historically accurate, violent, explicit and blood and gore tale that revolves around the savage ways of the viking culture and how they "found new ways to the new earth".

Vikings are renowned for numerous things. Viking boats, weapons, wars, their sharp-horned-helmets (which, by the way, not true), glorious godly beards, mythology are some of the things that shape their profound culture. I, for one, am extremly intrigued by their boats and mythology - Odin, Thor, Loki, Fenrir, Asgard, Yggdrasil, Valhalla all find special place in my heart. There mythology was the prime reason to watch this series spending hours staring at the screen, and I don't regret, as this brought me to read more about their culture and way of life.

The protagonist of series, Ragnar Lothbruk, a visionary farmer who rises to power to become a cheiftan and a celebrated Norse hero.
