## The Take Off

I reached the Mumbai international airport at 10:00 PM and scrambled my bag for passport as the security were asking the for tickets and identifications. I had only once traveled by a plane before, from Pune to Goa and that is a 40 min plane ride. Later I would find out international flights are nothing like that caricature of an experience I had before.

I was all equiped with the necessary documents that I was supposed to have. So I clear the airport gate security and enter the premises. The first thing I notice is the stark constrast in the landscape from Chembur and Vashi to that of the Airport. The airport's architechture is beautiful with giant ornate pillars holding the vast canopy of the roof which follows into the same design pattern of the pillars.

This was the first time I was on an international airport terminal with no idea of the first thing I've to do, and the intimidatingly large airport was not helping. Few impromptu calls and more than a few Google searches later I had a rough idea of what was expected. I dropped the baggage, got my boarding pass, exhanged currency, cleared security check, cleared immigration, and arrived at the terminal. The anxiety had passed and I was waiting calmly for the boarding to start.


## The Arrival


This was a 10 hour over-night flight from Mumbai to Zurich airport. I dozed off soon after the flight took off, being exausted from the preparation, packing, and the high-traffic Mumbai commute. I was woken up by the Air Hostess the later morning for breakfast, the flight was 1 and half hours to land. I opted for the non-vegeterian breakfast and was not too delited with the experience. There was the packed breakfast before me and I had given a fork and spoon to have at it, and thus the struggle began.

You can count on a single hand the times I've had breakfast with a spoon-and-fork, this experience bring that total count to 1. Anyways, I had a long journey ahead and got the meal in my belly by the means available. I reached the Zurich airport by 6:30 AM (Local time) and the cabin crew greeted me off as I departed the vessel. 

It was the start of cold, the month of October. And it was indeed a chilly welcome for someone who shivers even in the Indian winters. It took me a day, or two, to adjust to the weather. The Zurich airport is huge with the railway station in the same building. I was roaming around deciphering the notation symbols, as everything was in German, trying to get to the baggage claim.

I was headed towards Basel, a small town at the base of the Alps mountain in Switzerland. Where I had remotely worked with the University of Basel, providing them with 'OpenSpecimen', a BioBank management software by Krishagni Pvt Ltd (Pune). I was here to meet the clients and collaborate with them on-site, training them in the software and resolving any related issues.

The next thing I notice is everything is so much thought out and well structured there. The metro train doors were accompanied by some marking on the grounds that separated the departing crowd from the boarding crowd. The ticket vendor at the train station had atleast 5 feet of undisturbed space only after which the queue would start, and she'd ask for the next customer one-by-one. Everything was so delineated, and I was loving it.

I got the ticket to Basel and the train was leaving in 15 minutes. I hopped on. I see there are hardly 5 people in the entire coach. I wonder if this is a normal crowd or was it just the Saturday morning. Everything was super clean, I tell you, the white sole of my shoes were as spotless when I left after 15 days as they were when I arrived.


## Basel, Switzerland.


The train left Zurich station and, in a while, left the city. And soon after, I witnessed the lush green landscapes that Switzerland is known for. It was a mesmerizing site. 

It's 7:30'ish in the morning, you can feel the cold breeze, and constrasting the cold are the pale-golden sunrays that are permeating through the fog, it's autumn and the long pointy trees have become orange to reddish, the distant hilltops standing against the morning sun. It is a feeling that I will take with me, a picture I cannot forget.

I reach Basel after a 90 minutes ride and took a tram to check-in to my Airbnb hotel. It's weekend and I had decided to explore this neat little city.

Basel is a historic city and there is a lot to see. You can see the old buildings, gates, musuems and churches and a bridge and the city itself is a wanderlust experience. And the people here are ridiculously, NICE. I don't know whether it was just me or this is a "creative recollection" but overall people seem very happy, warm towards others and nice in-general.

I loved the city and in particular the musuems. I'm a museum fanatic and they happen to have multiple of them here. So, the first thing I do is visit the "Musuem Of Natural History". This museum has large number of specimens ranging from the ancient tropical predatory cats (skeloton of a sabertooth cat) to the excotic createrues from the depth of the sea (Nautilus fossils and shells). 

I was blown away by the life-sized recreation models of the animals.

I would say I qualify as an introvert and a chronic gamer and normally abstain from travel. Despite that, I traveled a lot in the two days. Rocking "_Illahi_", on repeat, in my headphones. I'd be lying if I said this didn't feel like something straight out of a movie.


## The work side

During my 15 days stay at Basel. I met with the existing and prospective clients. I saw the guts of a biobank. I was taught how exactly they form a bacterial culture from the specimen that come in and I saw huge freezers rooms and what not. 

The working hours were pretty lenient compared to back home. Swiss people start work very early, usually by 8:00 AM and wrap up by 5:00 PM. I'm a morning person, mostly, and this struck home



It's true that you learn by being involved and It was great a learning experience for me.
