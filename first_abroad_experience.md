## The Take Off

I reached the Mumbai international airport at 10:00 PM and scrambled my bag for passport as the security were asking the for tickets and identifications. I had only once traveled by a plane before, form Pune to Goa and that is a 40 min plane ride. Later I would find out international flights are nothing like that caricature of an experience I had before.

I was all equiped with the necessary documents that I was suppose to have. So I clear the airport gate security and enter the airport premises. The first I notice is the stark constrast in the landscape from Chembur and Vashi to that of the Airport. The airport's architechture is beautiful with giant ornate pillars holding the vast canopy of the roof which follows into the same design of the pillars.

This was the first time I was on an international airport terminal with no idea of the first thing I've to do and the intimidatingly large airport was not helping. Few impromptu calls and more than few Google searches later I had a rough idea of what was expected. I dropped the baggage, got my boarding pass, exhanged currency, cleared security check, cleared immigration, and arrived at the terminal. The anxiety had passed and I was waiting calmly for the boarding to start.

## The Arrival

This was a 10 hour over-night flight from Mumbai to Zurich airport.
