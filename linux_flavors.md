# Linux Flavors: Choose your pick

![alt text](https://swapnil-ingle.github.io/images/linux-flavors.png "Linux Flavors Banner")

Linux, mostly confused by beginners as being an operating system, is the kernel, the heart of the operating system. 
The array of tools, UI, shell and other parts that encapsulates the whole user experience is provided by different distributions
by different firm. This whole package is called a distribution or flavor or distros, pick whatever you like!

Though the heart remains true, the other aspect of the operating system varies from flavor to flavor and each type maybe suitable
for each person while being a mystery for the other. These different flavors are honed to their application domain, providing
solutions/applications that are specific to their field.

Ubuntu, is one the many available linux's flavors, it is developed targeting the normal user to industry level usage. 
So, what's the story of Ubuntu? Why did it came to be?

When Linux kernel was made by Linus another genius, Richard Stallmann, had worked on the other aspect that requires to fulfill the OS; the programs! These were developed for minix - an operating system based on UNIX (Godfather to LINUX).
This OS was first targeted for cloud-hosting solutions, but as the product grew it expanded into different number of "distribution" expressing the ideas of different developers.

## Ubuntu

Ubuntu was created by Mark Shuttleworth and a developmental team in 2004 to bring the Linux operating system to all PC 
users rather than just those administering servers. Ubuntu is a general purpose desktop OS that requires minimum level of expertise to work upon, so if you're just a noob who's getting started or someone who don't require much functionalitites other than general purpose tools you might just give this a go!

There is an elaborate system in place that guides the growth of ubuntu, this is owned by a company named 'Canonical'. There are technical team, councils, boards, etc.

## Red Hat

In 1993, a startup called Red Hat was founded by Bob Young and Marc Ewing. Red Hat combined all the opensource softwares into the distribution (Red Hat Linux 1.0). Now known as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). The company RedHat Inc. oversees the growth of this operating system. They earn money primarily by providing Paid Professional Support.

## CentOS and Fedora

CentOS is enterprise grade OS that chooses Stability over innovation, as enterprise require stable OS for hosting their servers. It was released in May 2004. In 2004 as well, the Red Hat people launched two different flavors, as many Linux enthusiasts wanted their existing distribution to focused on innovation, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) an enterprise level OS for the enterprise people while Fedora for Linux enthusiasts, Fedora instead of being managed by RedHat is managed by open-source developers.

CentOS head developers are employed by RedHat Inc. which work on 'Red Hat opensource and standards' team. Also, Fedora is sponsored by RedHat.

## Kali Linux

So I see you a security guy. Interested in hacking or penetration testing!? Kali Linux is a flavor distinctly useful for exploiting security vulnerabilities. 
"Kali Linux is an open source project that is maintained and funded by Offensive Security, a provider of world-class information security training and penetration testing services."

## Puppy Linux

Puppy Linux was originally created by Barry Kauler in 2003, as a smaller, leaner version of Vector Linux.

Puppy Linux is designed to be very small and lightweight OS that can run well on every old computer and computers with less RAM. The puppy ISO file is least of 161 MB, and Puppy Linux can be booted from that disc to a live environment. Puppy Linux can run on PCs with 256 MB of RAM still you would need 512 MB for  best user experience and puppy Linux can definitely help you to reclaim your old PC.

The people who care-takes Puppy Linux distros are called are [Stewards of Puppy Linux](http://puppylinux.com/team.html)

Currently the master steward for Puppy Linux is **Mick Amadio** who oversees the overall growth of this flavor.

# Choosing your pick

There is no "one for all, all for one" flavor, depending on what hardware you working on and depending on what your general objective or purpose is there will be some flavors out there that suited to your needs better than other. Based upon the information above and digging around a lil' bit, you can choose what flavor satiates your taste buds.

You can find tonns of guides and how-to(s) and quizes and [tests](https://distrochooser.de/en) to help you choose a flavor that suits your best needs.

## Explore and experiment 

Considering how dynamic and extensive the linux distribution society is, you might not want to be restricted to only one distro. I'll say explore, have some fun, experiment with what different distros have to offer because this is how you'll get the first-hand idea of what suits you the best.
