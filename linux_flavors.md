Linux, mostly confused by beginners as being an operating system, is the kernel, the heart of the operating system. 
The array of tools, UI, shell and other parts that encapsulates the whole user experience is provided by different distributions
by different firm. This whole package is called a distribution or flavor or distros, pick whatever you like!

Though the heart remains true, the other aspect of the operating system varies from flavor to flavor and each type maybe suitable
for each person while being a mystery for the other. These different flavors are honed to their application domain, providing
solutions/applications that are specific to their field.

Ubuntu, is one the many available linux's flavors, it is developed targeting the normal user to industry level usage. 
So, what's the story of Ubuntu? Why did it came to be?

When Linux kernel was made by Linus another genius, Richard Stallmann, had worked on the other aspect that requires to fulfill the OS; the programs! These were developed for minix - an operating system based on UNIX (Godfather to LINUX).
This OS was first targeted for cloud-hosting solutions, but as the product grew it expanded into different number of "distribution" expressing the ideas of different developers.

## Ubuntu

Ubuntu was created by Mark Shuttleworth and a developmental team in 2004 to bring the Linux operating system to all PC 
users rather than just those administering servers.

There is an elaborate system in place that guides the growth of ubuntu, this is owned by a company named 'Canonical'. There are technical team, councils, boards, etc.

## Red Hat

In 1993, a startup called Red Hat was founded by Bob Young and Marc Ewing. Red Hat combined all the opensource softwares into the distribution (Red Hat Linux 1.0). Now known as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). The company RedHat Inc. oversees the growth of this operating system. They earn money primarily by providing Paid Professional Support.

## CentOS and Fedora

CentOS is enterprise grade OS that chooses Stability over innovation, as enterprise require stable OS for hosting their servers. It was released in May 2004. In 2004 as well, the Red Hat people launched two different flavors, as many Linux enthusiasts wanted their existing distribution to focused on innovation, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) an enterprise level OS for the enterprise people while Fedora for Linux enthusiasts, Fedora instead of being managed by RedHat is managed by open-source developers.

CentOS head developers are employed by RedHat Inc. which work on 'Red Hat opensource and standards' team. Also, Fedora is sponsored by RedHat.

## Kali Linux

Interested in hacking!? Kali Linux is a flavor distinctly useful for exploiting security vulnerabilities. 
"Kali Linux is an open source project that is maintained and funded by Offensive Security, a provider of world-class information security training and penetration testing services."
