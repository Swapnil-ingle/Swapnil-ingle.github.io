## Avoiding Redundant words
###### Lessons in being an elite writer

You should always try to cut the redundant words from your sentences to make the writing more punchy and economical.

These words often appear side-by-side. For example, it's common to see people writing _“The sum total …”_, well, the *"sum"* is always *"the total"*. 
You don't need to mention it twice.

> Cut it out!

Given below are some examples that would help you look out for such words and reduce the clutter in your writing.

### Example #1:
The four pebbles in his left hand and two in his right added up to a sum total of six stones.

**New:** The four pebbles in his left hand and two in his right added up to ~~a sum total of~~ six stones.

### Example #2:
When Bob opened his present, he got an unexpected surprise: inside the box was the red shirt he’d always wanted.

**New:** When Bob opened his present, he got an ~~unexpected~~ surprised by seeing the red shirt that he’d always wanted.

*Explanation:* A surprise, by nature, is always unexpected.

### Example #3:
The project, a joint collaboration between the two rival firms, was a huge success.

**New:** The project, ~~a joint collaboration~~ between the two rival firms was a huge success.

**Explanation:** 1. A project is always a joint collaboration.

### Example #4: 
Michaels boss summoned Paul to his office to discuss the department’s future plans.

**New:** Michaels boss summoned Paul to his office to discuss the department’s ~~future~~ plans. 

**Explanation:** You always plan for the future.

### Example #5: 
Passive sentences harm not only clarity but also simplicity and evocativeness as well.

**New:** Passive sentences harm not only clarity but also simplicity and evocativeness ~~as well~~.

**Explanation:** No need to add “_as well_” because using “_and_” already fulfills that purpose.

### Example #6: 
The athlete, born in China, set a new record at the last Olympics.

**New:** The Chinese athlete, ~~born in China,~~ set a ~~new~~ record at the last Olympics. 

**Explanation:** A record set is always new, it’s only required to use the word ‘_new_’ if you’re distinguishing the record from the one that was set earlier.

There are many such examples out there, try to look out for such words and eliminate them.
